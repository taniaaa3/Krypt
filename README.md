"Krypt" is a web3 dApp project through which a user can send and receive "Ethers (ETH)" easily and all the transactions done through krypt will be showed below on the page with all the details. This is a practice project which I've made for just my own practice and to advance my skills. The styling is inspired from a tutorial but all the wallet connecting, transaction sending and storing are done by me.
